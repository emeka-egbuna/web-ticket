This is a simple static website built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and deployed on GitHub using Git and Agile Software Development.

The layout is comprised of a Header with the name of the site and three links, following is the Hero image and below is a two column body section divided in a 3:1 ratio. And at the bottom end is the Footer.

The HTML source code makes use of semantic tags to structure the website and also makes use of indentations to make a neat script and avoids clutering.

Site visitors and users can follow the link above to view the site on GitHub pages to have a preview of the site as more features will be added in the near future as the website development is still in progress. While the source code could also be viewed from the links above.

The Licence implemented for the site is the MIT licence which is a permissive free software license as it puts only very limited restriction on reuse. The site source codes are free to view and/or reuse. Users can use, copy, modify, merge publish, distribute, sublicense and sell copies of the software
